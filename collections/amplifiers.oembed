We wanted an amp that sounded more musical and energetic than anything we’ve made before. They beavered away for months and after some particularly late nights they eventually nailed it. To achieve this they used some unique engineering techniques, some very premium components, and some great ears for detail.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch6\u003eListen to your music at its best\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve used an audiophile-grade toroidal transformer which helps minimise magnetic flux levels. This basically keeps distortion and other noise levels low so that your music is played back with complete purity. We also centrally mount the transformer to reduce interference with other components in the circuit board such as the volume pot; this is in a further effort to keep your music sounding amazing.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch6\u003eAn amplifier for the digital world\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CXA60 was designed to work with digital sources from the outset so has a 24-bit Wolfson WM8740 DAC (a very premium digital to analogue converter) built in.

Featuring ESS 32-bit HyperStream® DAC architecture and Time Domain Jitter Eliminator, the amplifier delivers a clear sound and minimal distortion. Built for the most discerning ears, the Heritage Headphone Amplifier doubles as an ideal processor of any digital source, whether the output is a pair of headphones or RCA line-out.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch6\u003eAsynchronous USB interface\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heritage Headphone Amplifier uses the XMOS USB audio receiver platform, widely regarded as one of the best solutions for transferring audio from USB sources. This allows the amplifier to lock the audio stream to its internal clock, keeping the audio stream as clean as possible. ASIO support is included for audio software that supports it. iOS (with Lighting™ to USB Camera Adapter, sold separately) and Android (5.0 Lollipop and newer) devices can also connect directly to the USB interface for lossless playback of content, bypassing your device’s digital-to-analog converter.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch6\u003eDual amplifiers\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplete with dual Class-AB TI TPA6120A2 amplifiers, the signal path minimizes crosstalk while increasing total system output. Built to have the best signal to noise ratio possible, the chosen amplifiers had to be as quiet as the reference DAC. Plug in any headphone with an XLR-4 balanced cable (not included) and you have a true audiophile solution. Flip the gain switch to “Hi-Z” for a +10 dB boost in output to drive even the most demanding headphones.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch6\u003eFeatures:\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAudiophile digital to analog converter\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAsynchronous USB interface\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDual amplifiers for balanced output\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVersatile inputs and outputs\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLow distortion\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a demo store.
