    <td colspan="2"><p>Combining the thundering, rich bass of R6i’s custom 6.5mm dual magnet dynamic driver with the exceptional tonal balance and high-frequency definition of the KG-723 balanced armature, the Klipsch XR8i Hybrid In-Ear Headphones deliver sound only paralleled by a home theater. Built with a true downward-firing subwoofer, the XR8i makes no compromises.</p>

<h6>Hybrid design with home theatre sound</h6>
<p>The Klipsch Reference line is famous for producing room-rattling home theater sound and we're bringing that to the XR8i Hybrid in-ear headphones. These puppies feature a built-in subwoofer (yes, really) that promises to deliver glorious bass while still producing the clarity you expect from a Klipsch headphone.</p>

<h6>Die-cast zinc and co-molded elastomer housing</h6>
<p>XR8i’s minimal design combines sturdy die-cast zinc for the front housing, optimally weighted to stay put inside your ear canal. The high quality and
durable rear housing is built from co-molded elastomer, a two-layer design with a rigid inner layer for support and a soft-touch pliable outer layer for comfort.</p>

<h6>Highs and lows</h6>
<p>Klipsch’s custom, single full-range KG-723 balanced armature delivers cleaner, more natural sounding vocals and perfectly defined upper frequencies only achievable through balanced armature technology. The XR8i utilizes a 6.5mm dual magnet dynamic driver to reproduce low, sub-bass—unheard of in a headphone of this caliber. With a moving coil driver focused on reproducing only low frequencies, the XR8i creates the headroom necessary to drive highly-dynamic recordings with high energy and without distortion.</p>

<li>KG-065 Dynamic Woofer</li>

With an all-day battery, call vibration alerts and carefully-selected real leather, these wireless in-ear monitors provide durability, comfort and audiophile-grade sound that's simply incomparable.</p>

<h6>Premium Audio Style</h6>

<h6>Call Vibration Alert</h6>
<p>Keep your phone in your bag and stop worrying about missing an important phone call. We placed a vibrating motor into the left control pod to pulsate against your collar bone to notify you of an incoming call.</p>

<h6>Audiophile Balanced Armature</h6>
<p>Utilizing a custom KG-926 balanced armature placed inside of a milled aluminum housing, X12 Neckband headphones achieves full range response from a tiny form factor. Ported and vented, the balanced armature driver delivers classic tube amplifier sound and unmatched bass performance. With a warm and lush soundstage, the KG-926 produces dynamics only rivaled by multi-armature counterparts.</p>
