As proof, Pioneer introduces the SP-BS22-LR bookshelf speakers. Whether you use them as stereo speakers or part of a multi-channel home theater system, their ability to handle 90 watts the SP-BS22-LR's deliver wide frequency response and sophisticated sound quality regardless of the source.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhatever your system, the SP-BS22-LR Bookshelf Speakers are ready to step it up with authentic audio reproduction to bring your listening experience to the next level.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch6\u003e70 Years of Audio Firsts\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese speakers come with a remarkable pedigree of over 70 years of Pioneer audio heritage and industry firsts. Like every speaker Pioneer builds, these are engineered to offer incredible design and amazing sound quality. Pioneer has brought their high-end expertise and passion to the creation of this affordable bookshelf speaker.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch6\u003eThinking Out Of the Box\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically you'll find most bookshelf speakers not only come in a box, they are a box. And while that might be better for production costs, it isn't better for sound reproduction. The SP-BS22-LR speakers utilize a true curved cabinet design. So besides the aesthetics being considerably more pleasing, this stiffer design reduces standing sound waves inside the cabinet, resulting in high-performance and exceptional sound quality.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you look at them, you'll also notice the unique speaker grills. They're beautiful and elegant in their own right, but not for their own sake. They protect the speakers, but are also removable if you prefer to see the drivers themselves.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch6\u003eThe Inside Story\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eCrossover\u003c\/em\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe job of the crossover in a speaker is to break the audio signal into low, high, and sometimes mid-range frequencies. It's an important job, and it uses circuitry like inductors and capacitors to accomplish it. Most speakers use an extremely simple, low-cost crossover made up of a single capacitor and inductor. The Pioneer SP-BS22-LR utilizes a sophisticated 6-element, high-quality crossover. The reasoning is simple: because it's one more way of ensuring high quality sound that makes its presence known.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eWoofer\u003c\/em\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the SP-BS22-LR, Pioneer has added a structured surface to the 4-inch woofer. By doing so, not only is rigidity improved, so is bass accuracy. Engineers have also vented the pole piece, improving bass response from the same size woofers in previous models.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eTweeter\u003c\/em\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo widen the sweet spot of the 1-inch High Efficiency Soft Dome tweeter, Pioneer has engineered a custom wave guide.
