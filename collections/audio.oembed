These premium headphones use our unique, Japanese-made FreeEdge drivers, which deliver a precise pistonic motion for ultra-accurate sound with minimal distortion. The drivers are mounted on vibration-reducing engineering resin baffles, fitted into self-damping real walnut housings designed to bring warmth and life to the sound. A detachable 7N-purity copper cable, made in Japan to Denon’s exacting specification, ensures the best possible signal transmission – it’s fitted with a durable machine-cut metal plug with an ornamental copper ring.
