<h6>Experience the next level of silence</h6>
<p>See what happens when it's just you and your music, with noise canceling that cuts more outside sound than ever before. And experience how smart headphones can be with advanced noise-canceling technology such as Adaptive Sound Control, and the convenience of smart features including Quick Attention, Voice Assistant compatibility and touch control.</p>

<h6>More power = even less noise</h6>
<p>With our new HD Noise-Canceling Processor QN1, noise-canceling power is greatly enhanced. Having a dedicated NC processor also ensures the reproduction of your music is never compromised due to processor performance.</p>

<h6>Smart listening by SENSE ENGINE – automatically adjusts to your situation</h6>
<p>See how Adaptive Sound Control automatically detects your activity such as traveling, walking, and waiting, then adjusts ambient sound settings to you. And with Quick Attention, you can communicate without removing your headphones — simply place your hand over the housing to turn the volume down for instant conversation.</p>

<h6>Automatically adjusts to whatever you do</h6>
<ul>
<li>Traveling: take trips without interruption and lose yourself in music with no background noise</li>
<li>Walking: be aware of everything around you, from street to office, while still enjoying music</li>
<li>Waiting: hear important announcements while you wait with reduced background noise</li>
</ul>

<h6>Wear all day in total comfort</h6>
<p>Super soft, pressure-relieving earpads in foamed urethane evenly distribute pressure and increase ear pad contact for a stable fit. Comfort is further enhanced by a larger and deeper ergonomic ear space structure. And with a lighter weight design, your music is the only thing you’ll notice all day.</p>

<h6>Smarter than your average headphones</h6>
<p>Everything is at your fingertips. Answer hands-free phone calls with a double tap - or change tracks, adjust the volume and make calls by touching or swiping the panel. And help from your phone’s voice assistant is just one long press away.</p>

<h6>All day power and quick charging</h6>
<p>With a huge 30 hours of battery life, you'll have enough power even for long trips away. And if you need to charge in a hurry, you can get five hours' worth of charge after just ten minutes with the optional AC adapter.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Hi-Res Audio headphones with Bluetooth® capability; the SE-MS7BT offers both wireless &amp; wired headphone solutions and are designed to fit comfortably around the ear for all day listening.</p>

<p>To ensure that you are getting the best sound, the SE-MS7BT supports Qualcomm® aptXTM audio and AAC for high quality audio. By having NFC built-in, this makes it simple to pair another device by simply touching the devices together. The SE-MS7BT headphones utilize Hi-Res capable large 40mm drivers that are fitted perfectly to the wide cushioned ear cups. The SE-MS7BT has controls built into the headphones. But don’t panic when the SE-MS7BT battery runs down, Pioneer has you covered with the included wired cable that allows you to continue listening. The SE-MS7BT are available, in Black, Silver and Tan.</p>

<h6>Enjoy wireless music and calls with the ease of Bluetooth</h6>
<p>Manage music and phone calls using the built in controls and microphone. Simplify the pairing process by using NFC, and listen to high quality audio by using aptX.

<h6>Wide cushioned headband earpads</h6>
<p>Attention to details was made when designing the headband and earpads. With the design of a wide headband, the weight gets distributed to a larger area by dispersing weight evenly. The earpads are designed to fit a variety of head shapes along with the design of the curve behind the ear to be ergonomic so it creates an even seal all around the ear for a good fit.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Master &amp; Dynamic has partnered with renowned architect Sir David Adjaye to design a bold and immersive new speaker. The WiFi or Bluetooth-connected speaker is made of an acoustically superior proprietary concrete composite. Audio componentry incorporates efficient dual 4” woven Kevlar long throw woofers and a 1.5” titanium tweeter. A magnetically attached stainless steel grille is removable for those that prefer the look of the exposed components and hand-finished concrete.</p>

<h6>Sculptural Composition</h6>
<p>Cast in a new geometric form, the proprietary concrete composite provides exceptional acoustic benefits such as increased dampening, reduced resonance, and a purer sound. The dampening properties are so high that the speaker can play at full volume without causing a record to skip or the table and floor to vibrate.</p>

<h6>Premium Materials</h6>
<p>Outfitted with dual 4" woven long throw woofers, a 1.5" titanium tweeter and diamond-cut anodized aluminum controls. An elegant, magnetically attached steel grille is removable for those that prefer the look of the exposed components and hand-finished concrete.</p>

<h6>Immersive Sound</h6>
<p>Constructed in a seamless, sealed concrete composite form, the speaker (16 x 20 x 10 in) easily fills a large room with sonically sophisticated sound, powered by 100 Watts of Class D amplification. It can be used as a single unit, stereo pair or multi-room setup via Chromecast built-in.</p>

<p>Warranty: we offer a limited 2-year warranty against defects.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Experience the peak of Marantz AV expertise in the new flagship SR8012 – the first-ever 11.2-channel Marantz receiver that raises the bar for home theater. Envelop yourself in thrilling and immersive surround sound with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and Auro 3D, the latest codecs able to drive overhead speakers for a true 3D sound experience. The receiver's 11 high-quality amplifier stages enhance audio performance via carefully selected high-grade audio components including Marantz Hyper Dynamic Amplifier Modules, or HDAMs, used in Current Feedback topology. These pass the signal to the power stages, each providing 205W of pure Marantz power and finesse to drive a full 7.1.4-channel home cinema setup without the need for additional external amplifiers.</p>

<p>And the SR8012 uses advanced Marantz sound-tuning throughout, drawing in features from the company's Reference two-channel models, including a copper chassis and an oversized, shielded toroidal transformer built to Marantz specification — plus high-current main power supply capacitors also made to the Marantz engineers' exacting standards.</p>

<p>With built-in HEOS technology, the SR8012 becomes a part of a HEOS wireless multi-room music network, enabling you to enjoy your favorite music anywhere around your home. Explore, browse, and play music from your music library, online streaming music services, or thousands of internet radio stations, using the free HEOS app.</p>
