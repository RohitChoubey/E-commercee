    <td colspan="2"><p>Elite’s brand-new universal disc player brings the spectacle of Ultra HD Blu-ray to your home entertainment, with four times the resolution of 1080P Full HD. Featuring three-block internal layout, Ultra rigid construction, and double-layered chassis for a robust build, 6-layered main circuit board, SDR/HDR preset mode, and support for HDR10/Dolby vision for quality picture, as well as premium audio DAC and zero signal terminal for high-grade sound, The UDP-LX500 lets you enjoy the highest video resolution as well as your other digital disc collections.</p>

<h6>Ultra HD Blu-ray Playback</h6>
<p>Certified by the UHD Alliance, the new Elite UDP-LX500 meets or exceeds strict performance specifications for resolution (4K – 4 times sharper than HD), high dynamic range (HDR – brilliant brights, deepest darks), and wide color spectrum (more lifelike colors). It also focuses on other video and audio attributes including immersive audio (multi-dimensional sound) among others.</p>

<h6>Three-Block Internal Layout</h6>
<p>The blocks for power supply, drive/digital processing, and analog audio are separated into three to eliminate electrical and magnetic interference between the blocks.</p>

<h6>6-Layered Main Circuit Board for High S/N Ratio</h6>
<p>A 6-layered IVH is used for the main circuit board to thoroughly eliminate digital noise. This optimizes the digital signal wiring and minimises GND impedance, and dramatically improves S/N ratio in audio/video signal processing. The 18 Gbps transmission through the latest HDMI standard becomes even more precise.</p>

<h6>PQLS Jitter-less Sound Transmission</h6>
<p>With the precision quartz controller on a compatible AV receiver, Pioneer’s PQLS (Precision Quartz Lock System) eliminates distortion caused by timing errors.</p>

<p>It controls the amount of audio signals from the AV receiver to the UDP-LX500, giving the best possible digital-to-analog conversion. UDP-LX500 supports PQLS 2ch Audio, Multi-Surround, and Bit-stream.</p>

<h6>Zero Signal Terminal</h6>
<p>The Zero Signal Terminal is a Pioneer-original feature dedicated to tuning audio and video quality without signal transmission. By connecting the Zero Signal Terminal with the audio/video input terminal of an AV receiver etc., the reference level (GND) of the audio/video signals is aligned between the two devices, and the potential difference is suppressed, allowing a precise and high-quality signal transmission.</p>

<h6>Features:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ultra HD Blu-ray playback</li>
<li>Three-block internal layout (power supply, drive/Digital processing, analog audio)</li>
<li>6-Layered main circuit board for high S/N Ratio</li>

<li>Dedicated headphone amplifier with all-discrete construction</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Marantz SA-10 is the latest model in a range of high-end players stretching all the way back to the dawn of CD: in the original CD-63, launched in 1983, it had the first high-end performance-tuned CD player, and that expertise has continued to be developed over more than 30 years. The SA-10 is designed to sets new standards, whether with music on disc or content streamed from a computer, and to become the New Reference in digital audio.</p>
<p>To achieve that, the SA-10 is a completely new design, drawing on all that experience in making great-sounding players but with virtually every part redesigned. That involved both innovation and some unique thinking, all in the cause of getting the best possible performance across a wide range of digital audio formats. The new model is an exceptional player of both CD and SACD discs, but can also play high-resolution music stored on computer-burned discs, as well as being a high-end digital to analogue converter for computer-stored music.</p>
<p>From the unique new disc transport designed for this player all the way through to a complete rethink of the way digital audio data is converted into analogue signals, the SA-10 is a ‘clean sheet’ design, the result of painstaking research and development and extensive listening in Marantz’s custom-built listening facilities. That’s symptomatic of the way Marantz has always done things: while it always aims for the most elegant engineering solution, the listening test is always the final arbiter. It’s all to do with that simple phrase running through the heart of everything the company does: ‘Because Music Matters’.</p>
