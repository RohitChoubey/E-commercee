    <td colspan="2"><p>Put more punch in your movie soundtracks with the SA-CS9, 115W Home Theater subwoofer. Bring the energy and passion of the original performance home.</p>

<h6>9.84 in active subwoofer for thumping bass</h6>
<p>The 9.84 in cone diaphragm can move a larger volume of air, producing powerful low-end resonance that makes bass sound rich and authentic. The subwoofer reinforces low frequency sounds in movies and music for a great multi-channel home theater experience.</p>

<h6>Mica Reinforced Cellular conem undistorted audio</h6>
<p>Many speakers use paper cones that flex and deteriorate over time, leading to a more distorted sound. Mica Reinforced Cellular (MRC) fiber woofers are rigid, holding their shape even when moving at high pressure and speed, so you can drive the bass harder without compromising audio quality.</p>

<h6>Power every beat with a built-in amplifier</h6>
<p>Drive bass-heavy music and bring your party alive. This subwoofer includes a built-in amplifier with up to 115 W power output. Electrical circuits susceptible to vibration are located outside the cabinet, releasing high pressure within the enclosure for a clear and powerful bass sound.</p>

<h6>Minimizing vibration for tight bass</h6>
<p>Suppressing vibration in the cabinet is vital for tight, accurate bass. Unwanted vibrations are handled in two ways: by acoustically absorbing waves generated from the rear pressure of the unit, and damping vibrations within the cabinet itself.</p>

<h6>Smart finish for style and substance</h6>
<p>This speaker has a smart black finish that blends with most contemporary interiors. The wood veneer also retains its shape well, ensuring that the sound won’t be influenced by changes in temperature and humidity.</p>

<h6>Compact design for small spaces</h6>
<p>Powerful and compact, this subwoofer is perfect for easy installation in tight spots. Because of the reduced baffle area, the speaker minimizes sound field distortion for optimum clarity and precision.</p>

<h6>General specifications:</h6>
<p>Fully realize the depth of all your movie soundtracks with this 10 in (25 cm) freestanding subwoofer, compatible with High-Resolution Audio. Immerse yourself in a deep, responsive low to mid range with the mica-reinforced cone, and enjoy enhanced audio clarity thanks to the Bass Reflex design.</p>
