    <td colspan="2"><p>Enjoy 4K HDR entertainment on our X930E with Android TV. With the new Slim Backlight Drive, this television offers extraordinary brightness in an ultra-thin design and with the incredible performance of the 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme, everything you watch is improved to near 4K HDR quality.</p>

<h6>Uncover The Detail With 4K HDR</h6>
<p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) will change the way you look at TV. Combined with 4K Ultra HD resolution, HDR video content delivers exceptional detail, color and contrast, with a far wider range of brightness than other video formats. The result is the most lifelike picture TVs have ever been able to create, with brilliant highlights and fine detail.</p>

<h6>Everything Should Look Like 4K HDR</h6>
<p>Our newly developed 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme outperforms our conventional 4K Processor X1 with 40% more real-time image processing power. It takes everything you watch and improves it to near 4K HDR quality. Object-based HDR Remaster technology can detect, analyze and optimize each object in the picture individually to adjust the overall contrast for a more natural and realistic picture on screen.</p>

<h6>Extraordinary Brightness, Ultra Slim Design</h6>
<p>Feel the sunlight burst through the trees. Our Slim Backlight Drive+ directs light where it’s needed, filling scenes with extra brightness and deep contrast, all in an ultra-slim TV.</p>

<h6>Ten Times The Contrast</h6>
<p>By precisely balancing the light output across the screen, dimming some areas and boosting others, X-tended Dynamic Range PRO 10x reveals a brightness range ten times that of a conventional LED-backlit TV. When combined with an HDR signal you’ll experience even greater brilliance in every scene as it increases the quality of HDR with finely-gradated bands of color and more vibrant hues.</p>

<h6>Vibrant Colors, Smooth Gradations</h6>
<p>Colors are as rich and vivid as nature’s own thanks to the Triluminos Display with more shades of red, green and blue than ever before. You’ll enjoy vibrant, authentic images that evoke the emotion in every scene. And, 4K HDR Super Bit Mapping reveals thousands of shades and gradations of light, for sunsets as bright and clear as real life.</p>

<h6>Upscale to a more natural picture</h6>
<p>The difference is clear. You’ll see lifelike detail and stunning clarity, no matter what you're watching. Two powerful image improvement databases work together, dynamically improving images in real time. 4K X-Reality PRO upscales images to near 4K clarity while a second database cleans the picture and reduce on-screen noise. Every single pixel is enhanced beautifully by the powerful 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>If TVs are measured on picture quality, then the Sony Z-series stands alone. Near perfect black levels combine with the ability to reproduce the brightness and color of the real world, while your favorites get up scaled to near-4K HDR brilliance. It’s a viewing experience that can’t be replicated.</p>

<h6>Unrivaled picture quality</h6>
<p>The all-new Backlight Master Drive can display an unprecedented dynamic range with near perfect black levels and dazzling brightness. How?</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrete LED Control: Backlight Master Drive uses a new, innovative algorithm to control the TV’s ultra-dense LED structure. Each LED is controlled individually for a picture even more precise than that of a standard full-array TV, which groups LEDs into larger zones.</li>
<li>Calibrated Beam Design: Send light only where it is needed. Each LED emits a straight beam for greater brightness and more accurate contrast than ever before.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Upscaling to near 4K HDR</h6>
<p>Our newly developed 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme outperforms our conventional 4K Processor X1 with 40% more real-time image processing power. It takes everything you watch and improves it to near 4K HDR quality. Object-based HDR Remaster technology can detect, analyze and optimize each object in the picture individually to adjust the overall contrast for a more natural and realistic picture on screen.</p>

<h6>Backlight brilliance</h6>
<p>Experience greater brilliance in every scene. X-tended Dynamic Range PRO utilizes the discrete LED control of Backlight Master Drive to create images with brighter peaks and more shadow detail. When combined with HDR video, X-tended Dynamic Range PRO increases the quality of HDR so you experience even greater color and contrast.</p>

<h6>Uncover the detail with 4K HDR</h6>
<p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) will change the way you look at TV. Combined with 4K Ultra HD resolution, HDR video content delivers exceptional detail, color and contrast, with a far wider range of brightness. The result is the most lifelike picture TVs have ever been able to create, with brilliant highlights and fine detail.</p>

<h6>Clear picture, smooth gradations</h6>
<p>Sunsets are as bright and clear as real life. Super bit mapping 4K HDR, a feature of the 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme, reveals thousands of shades and gradations of light. It creates a smooth, natural picture as you watch, without the 'banding'. 14-bit signal processing recognizes subtle color transitions and effectively smooths out the gradation between shades, to show 64 times the color levels of a conventional display.</p>

<h6>More color, depth and realism</h6>
<p>Colors are as rich and vivid as nature’s own thanks to the TRILUMINOS Display with more shades of red, green and blue than ever before. You’ll enjoy vibrant, authentic images that evoke the emotion in every scene. When combined with HDR video, TRILUMINOS Display further increases the color depth for noticeably brighter and more realistic colors.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>The wonder of the cinema comes home with 4K HDR clarity. A 2,200 lumen Z-Phosphor laser light source brings exceptionally bright and clear colors, contrast, and motion for over 20,000 hours of play time. With the ARC-F lens equipped for ultra-crisp images, you’ll wonder how you watched movies before the VW995ES.</p>

<h6>Native 4K resolution for lifelike pictures</h6>
<p>With more than four times the resolution of Full HD, native 4K offers 8.8 million pixels (4096 x 2160) for a picture that is incredibly lifelike, which is why it is the resolution defined by the DCI (Digital Cinema Initiative) for theater distribution.

Fine details are wonderfully clear and natural, without jagged edges or visible pixels.</p>

<h6>Digital Focus Optimizer</h6>
<p>Optimum focus is achieved, not only optically, but also digitally, by the Digital Focus Optimizer. It compensates in advance from the possible optical degradation of the lens, then outputs the optimum corrected images, so that even the focus in the corners is better than ever.</p>

<h6>Corner-to-corner sharpness with the ARC-F lens</h6>
<p>For pristine image quality across the entire screen, the VPL-VW995ES features an All-Range Crisp Focus (ARC-F) lens. This large-aperture lens adopts an all-glass design for its 18 elements, including six extra low-dispersion (ELD) elements. This ensures optimal convergence of the red, green and blue primaries even at the extreme edges of the image for a clear and vivid image wherever you look.</p>

<h6>Motorized zoom lens and wide lens shift</h6>
<p>Installing this projector in your room is easy with a motorized zoom with a wide lens shift range. Adjust the position of the projector up to 80% vertically and 31% horizontally to get just the right angle for your movies without creating image distortion or resolution loss.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Go from living space, to theatre and back again with the amazing flexibility of this ultra-short throw projector that lets you experience over 100" of 4K HDR picture quality on any wall. With no limits on the design or layout of your home, it’s never been easier to live the dream of having a large screen display when and where you want it.</p>

<h6>Native 4K resolution for lifelike pictures</h6>
<p>With more than four times the resolution of Full HD, native 4K offers 8.8 million pixels (4096 x 2160) for a picture that’s so incredibly lifelike, it’s like looking at the real thing. This is the same resolution defined by Digital Cinema Initiatives for cinema distribution, with pixels one quarter the size of those used by traditional Full HD 1080p projectors. See corner-to-corner clarity and watch movies from much closer than you would in Full HD.</p>

<h6>Ultra-short throw distance for flexible installation</h6>
<p>The VPL-VZ1000ES has been designed with flexible installation in mind. Place the projector 6” away from a wall and you’ll enjoy a beautiful 100” (diagonal, 16:9 aspect ratio) display; move the projector 10” away from the wall and this screen size increases to a huge 120”. So whether it’s placed on the floor, mounted on the ceiling or used for rear projection, you can be sure that you’ll always see the big picture.</p>

<h6>2500 Lumens for spectacular brightness</h6>
<p>Savor the action with an incredible 2500 lumens brightness, for high contrast across the screen. A highly efficient Z-Phosphor laser light generates the brightness required for vibrant images across the whole screen.</p>

<h6>High dynamic contrast for stunning realism</h6>
<p>The VPL-VZ1000ES's SXRD panels and laser light source help the projector achieve a high dynamic contrast. This means that the full color spectrum – from deep, inky blacks through to vibrant reds, blues and greens – is replicated with fine detail and realism, making every scene spring to life for truly immersive cinematic experience.</p>

<h6>Reality creation upscales your favorites</h6>
<p>Upscale your existing Blu-ray Disc and DVD movies to near 4K-quality. The super-resolution Reality Creation 4K upscaler analyses every pixel in any direction, then employs a digital signal processing algorithm to map pixels against an ever-evolving picture patterning database, compiled from over 10 years of expertise, to enhance colors, contrast, and textures.</p>

<h6>Watch for longer with a Z-Phosphor laser light</h6>
<p>Inside the VPL-VZ1000ES is an ultra-pure, reliable Z-Phosphor laser light source. You'll enjoy perfectly clear 4K pictures plus up to 20,000 hours of uninterrupted operation, with no lamp replacement and virtually zero maintenance.</p>
