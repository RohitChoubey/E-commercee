    <td colspan="2"><p>A piano comes into this world through the perfect synergy of advanced technical skill and artistry. Such a piano can create sound that truly reflects the player's feelings. The final stage in piano production is called “voicing.” This breathes life into the instrument and truly makes it musical. To accomplish this, highly skilled experts focus their concentration and sensitivity completely on each note and delicately adjust the hardness and resilience of the hammers that strike the strings, establishing the perfect, consistent sound for the entire instrument and determining its tonal personality.</p>
<p>Yamaha brings this exact same approach and process to its audio products. Our experienced technicians perform exhaustive listening tests and strictly consider every single element and component, to draw closer — step by meticulous step — to the ideal sound. Introducing the S3000 Series, the absolute culmination of hi-fidelity audio. Yamaha knows all about sound and even more about music, and has brought all its rich artistic sensitivity into the creation of this line.</p>

The sound created by the S2100 Series, reverberating vibrantly in the ears, and reverberating vibrantly in your ears, and resonating in your heart.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>The PM6006 is an upgraded successor of the multi-award-winning PM6005. We've retained the pre-amp and power-amp sections that exclusively feature discrete components - not a single IC in sight of the signal path. The PM6006 is upgraded for peak current at the amplifier stage, which makes it possible to refine the sound for you in much more detail.</p><p>You can connect this superb integrated amplifier directly to a vast range of digital sources and use its superior 24bit/192kHz high current CS4398 DAC to create an unbelievably high level of audio enjoyment with new media. The unit now includes 2 optical and 1 coaxial digital inputs (an additional optical input from the predecessor, PM6005), and the complete digital section is fully shielded by an extra metal housing to ensure that the digital stage has no effect on the analog signal.</p>

<p>All of the original features—such as five-line audio input including phono, two-pairs of gold-plated speaker connections with the convenience of bi-wiring, and a remote handset—are all still there. The lower impedance shielded Toroidal transformer, as well as customized components and unique Marantz HDAM modules care for powerful, dynamic and detailed original Marantz sound. In short, the new PM6006 is a new star with excellent genes.</p>

<h6>Marantz HDAM Technology</h6>
<p>Marantz developed its own discrete circuit boards to replace standard IC's. These HDAM's consists of discrete surface mount components with short mirror image L/R signal paths. Those devices are doing exactly the same thing as the Op-Amps, but outperform the regular IC Op-amps dramatically in terms of the Slew Rate and reduced noise level, resulting in a much more dynamic, accurate and detailed sound. Over the years Marantz developed different types of the HDAM to improve quality and to fit to the special requirements of a product category like CD or amplifier.</p>

<h6>Current Feedback</h6>
<p>The Current Feedback amplifier technology provides wide-bandwidth and high-speed sound reproduction. In combination with the Toroidal Transformer, the PM6006's amplifier holds a massive energy reserve to drive even demanding speakers with absolute ease.</p>

<h6>Toroidal Transformer</h6>
<p>A Toroidal transformer has several advantages over a normal EI core transformer. It is very efficient and therefore delivers more power compared to the same size of an EI core transformer. In addition, due to its shape, the electromagnetic radiation and the mechanical vibration are extremely low all ending in a better sound quality.</p>

<h6>High Current Power Supply</h6>
<p>The power supply has high current high speed Shottky Barrier Diodes and high current storage capacitors that together provide wide dynamic range along with low impedance drive capability.</p>

<h6>Reference Quality D/A Conversion for Digital Input</h6>
<p>The PM6006 features high resolution D/A conversion and is equipped with the reference class CS4398 D/A converter, which provides up to 192 kHz/24 bit resolution for optimum fidelity with high resolution audio file types.</p>

<h6>Expanded Connectivity for Digital Inputs (2 Optical, 1 Coax) with Hi-res Audio Support</h6>
<p>1 Coax digital and 2 Optical digital inputs are now available to connect digital devices and play back Hi-res Audio (up to 192kHz/24bit PCM) through the PM6006's advanced audio circuitry. And the complete digital section is fully shielded by an extra metal housing to ensure that the digital stage has no effect on the analog signal.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Encased in formed aluminum with genuine walnut veneer, the Heritage Headphone Amplifier exudes quality before plugging in your headphones. All switches, knobs, and controls are weighted and anodized aluminum for great feel and tactile response. All analog switches operate through relays for the cleanest signal while maintaining a vintage feel.</p>

<h6>Digital to analog converter</h6>
<p>Driven at the core by a high-resolution ES90128K2M ESS Sabre32 Reference digital-to-analog (DAC) converter capable of 192kHz/24-bit sample rates, the Heritage Headphone Amplifier is the ideal 2-channel audiophile-grade DAC. Featuring ESS 32-bit HyperStream® DAC architecture and Time Domain Jitter Eliminator, the amplifier delivers a clear sound and minimal distortion. Built for the most discerning ears, the Heritage Headphone Amplifier doubles as an ideal processor of any digital source, whether the output is a pair of headphones or RCA line-out.</p>

<h6>Asynchronous USB interface</h6>
<p>The Heritage Headphone Amplifier uses the XMOS USB audio receiver platform, widely regarded as one of the best solutions for transferring audio from USB sources. This allows the amplifier to lock the audio stream to its internal clock, keeping the audio stream as clean as possible. ASIO support is included for audio software that supports it. iOS (with Lighting™ to USB Camera Adapter, sold separately) and Android (5.0 Lollipop and newer) devices can also connect directly to the USB interface for lossless playback of content, bypassing your device’s digital-to-analog converter.</p>

<h6>Dual amplifiers</h6>
<p>Complete with dual Class-AB TI TPA6120A2 amplifiers, the signal path minimizes crosstalk while increasing total system output. Built to have the best signal to noise ratio possible, the chosen amplifiers had to be as quiet as the reference DAC. Plug in any headphone with an XLR-4 balanced cable (not included) and you have a true audiophile solution. Flip the gain switch to “Hi-Z” for a +10 dB boost in output to drive even the most demanding headphones.</p>

<h6>Features:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Audiophile digital to analog converter</li>
<li>Asynchronous USB interface</li>
<li>Dual amplifiers for balanced output</li>
<li>Versatile inputs and outputs</li>
<li>Low distortion</li>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Designing the CXA60 was a challenge that was accepted with open arms by our engineers. We wanted an amp that sounded more musical and energetic than anything we’ve made before. They beavered away for months and after some particularly late nights they eventually nailed it. To achieve this they used some unique engineering techniques, some very premium components, and some great ears for detail.</p>

<h6>Listen to your music at its best</h6>
<p>We’ve used an audiophile-grade toroidal transformer which helps minimise magnetic flux levels. This basically keeps distortion and other noise levels low so that your music is played back with complete purity. We also centrally mount the transformer to reduce interference with other components in the circuit board such as the volume pot; this is in a further effort to keep your music sounding amazing.</p>

<h6>An amplifier for the digital world</h6>
<p>The CXA60 was designed to work with digital sources from the outset so has a 24-bit Wolfson WM8740 DAC (a very premium digital to analogue converter) built in. This chip is as the heart of our award-winning DacMagic range. So whether it’s music from your TV or your network streaming device, it all gets passed through the Wolfson DAC. Connecting the CXA60 to the digital out of the CXC dedicated CD transport also creates a perfect partnership. The result is that any digital music soars to new heights, reveals new depths and can be enjoyed like never before.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>The Azur 651W is a two channel power amplifier, capable of producing 100W per channel into 8 Ohms or 150W per channel into 4 Ohms and with a frequency response of 5Hz – 80kHz +-1dB. It's designed specifically to be partnered with a high quality preamplifier such as the Stream Magic 6.</p>

<p>By separating out power amplifier functionality, our engineers were able to give this amplifier the time and dedication that it needs to deliver the ultimate performance. By featuring both fully balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA analogue audio inputs, the 651W is, of course, designed to work in perfect synergy with a dedicated Cambridge Audio pre-amplifier. By connecting a digital pre-amplifier such the Stream Magic 6, the 651W provides the powerhouse in a truly astonishing digital music system!</p>

<h6>Immense power</h6>
<p>Into 8 Ohms, the 651W outputs 100W per channel in stereo mode. Into 4 Ohms, this figure increases to 150W per channel!</p>

<h6>Dual mono design</h6>
<p>The 651W uses a clever dual mono amplifier design – this means that we take separate feeds from the large toroidal transformer and process the left and right channels separately, meaning that the 651W is effectively two mono block amplifiers put together in one chassis – this gives superior stereo imaging and soundstaging to the competition.</p>
