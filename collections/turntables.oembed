Good turntables are now more important than ever. Marantz embraces an audiophile quality turntable with AC servo belt-drive and low-coloration tone arm to answer the need for a high performance source component for the analog record.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch6\u003eGeneral specifications:\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLow-Resonance High-Density Acrylic Chassis and Platter\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFloating Motor Mount Construction\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAsynchronous AC Motor\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBelt Drive System with Endless Silicon Belt\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnodized Aluminum Straight Type Tone Arm\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMagnetic Type Anti-Skating Mechanism\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFine Adjustable Counter Weight\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSolid Aluminum 3 points Support Feet\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWood Base, High Quality MM Cartridge\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\"Clever Clamp\" by Souther Engineering\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a demo store.
