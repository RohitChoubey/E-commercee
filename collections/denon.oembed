The drivers are mounted on vibration-reducing engineering resin baffles, fitted into self-damping real walnut housings designed to bring warmth and life to the sound. A detachable 7N-purity copper cable, made in Japan to Denon’s exacting specification, ensures the best possible signal transmission – it’s fitted with a durable machine-cut metal plug with an ornamental copper ring.

Aimed at those who want the very best sound whether traveling, working or relaxing, the new in-ear models are packed with advanced Denon technologies, designed to deliver the best possible performance from compact, lightweight earphones.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AH-C720, available in black and silver, uses an 11.5mm driver, mounted in housings combining die-cast aluminium and resin, designed for rigidity and vibration-damping. Denon’s Acoustic Optimiser technology helps equalizing the air-pressure in front of and behind the driver. It’s all part of making the sound as dynamic and distortion-free as possible.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe direct successor to the popular AH-C710, it’s designed for life on the move, with fibre-mesh cover on its cable for durability. Audio enthusiasts often complain about the noise generated from the cable rubbing against their chest when they’re moving. Denon’s specially designed Radial Cascade Damper system reduces cable-transmitted vibration noise, enabling you to enjoy studio-quality music on the go.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the AH-C720 is fitted with Comply TX400 ear-tips, which combine with the ergonomically-shaped housings to give a secure fit for the purest sound and maximum isolation from external noise. The tips use memory foam activated by the heat of the user’s ears, and have an integral wax-guard to keep the inside of the earphones clean. Four sizes of silicon ear-tips are also provided, along with a carrying case and cable clip.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo round up, the AH-C720 can be used with the dedicated Denon Audio Application for iOS and Android, allowing you to enhance the sound and tune it to suite your personal preferences. This app not only optimises the sound of portable devices, it also offers an improved player interface supporting queuing, and playlisting, and allows the user to access over 70,000 radio stations and 2 million on-demand programs via the TuneIn Internet Radio platform.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch6\u003eGeneral specifications:\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImpedance: 16 ohm\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSensitivity: 110 dB\/mW\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMaximum power input: 250 mW\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrequency response: 5-40,000 (Hz)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWeight: 8.6 g (not including cable)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003ch6\u003eIncluded accessories:\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEasy to go carrying case\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne pair of Comply TX400 ear-tips\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFour pairs of silicon ear-tips (XS, S, M, L)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCable Clip\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a demo store.
