<h6>Native 4K SXRD panel</h6>
<p>The advanced Silicon X-tal Reflective Display (SXRD) panel technology featured in our digital theater projectors delivers native 4K (4096 x 2160) resolution images, with more than four times the detail of Full HD.

    <td colspan="2"><p>The wonder of the cinema comes home with 4K HDR clarity. A 2,200 lumen Z-Phosphor laser light source brings exceptionally bright and clear colors, contrast, and motion for over 20,000 hours of play time. With the ARC-F lens equipped for ultra-crisp images, you’ll wonder how you watched movies before the VW995ES.</p>

<h6>Native 4K resolution for lifelike pictures</h6>
<p>With more than four times the resolution of Full HD, native 4K offers 8.8 million pixels (4096 x 2160) for a picture that is incredibly lifelike, which is why it is the resolution defined by the DCI (Digital Cinema Initiative) for theater distribution. See corner-to-corner clarity and watch movies from much closer than you would in Full HD.</p>

<h6>Native 4K SXRD panel</h6>
<p>The advanced Silicon X-tal Reflective Display (SXRD) panel technology featured in our digital theater projectors delivers native 4K (4096 x 2160) resolution images, with more than four times the detail of Full HD. Fine details are wonderfully clear and natural, without jagged edges or visible pixels.</p>

<h6>Digital Focus Optimizer</h6>
<p>Optimum focus is achieved, not only optically, but also digitally, by the Digital Focus Optimizer. It compensates in advance from the possible optical degradation of the lens, then outputs the optimum corrected images, so that even the focus in the corners is better than ever.</p>

<h6>Corner-to-corner sharpness with the ARC-F lens</h6>
<p>For pristine image quality across the entire screen, the VPL-VW995ES features an All-Range Crisp Focus (ARC-F) lens. This large-aperture lens adopts an all-glass design for its 18 elements, including six extra low-dispersion (ELD) elements. This ensures optimal convergence of the red, green and blue primaries even at the extreme edges of the image for a clear and vivid image wherever you look.</p>

<h6>Motorized zoom lens and wide lens shift</h6>
<p>Installing this projector in your room is easy with a motorized zoom with a wide lens shift range. Adjust the position of the projector up to 80% vertically and 31% horizontally to get just the right angle for your movies without creating image distortion or resolution loss.</p>


<h6>General specifications:</h6>
<p>Transform your space and bring lifelike pictures to your entertainment with the VPL-VW995ES home theater projector, featuring SXRD technology, with native 4K resolution and infinite dynamic contrast for stunning realism.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Go from living space, to theatre and back again with the amazing flexibility of this ultra-short throw projector that lets you experience over 100" of 4K HDR picture quality on any wall. With no limits on the design or layout of your home, it’s never been easier to live the dream of having a large screen display when and where you want it.</p>

<h6>Native 4K resolution for lifelike pictures</h6>
<p>With more than four times the resolution of Full HD, native 4K offers 8.8 million pixels (4096 x 2160) for a picture that’s so incredibly lifelike, it’s like looking at the real thing. This is the same resolution defined by Digital Cinema Initiatives for cinema distribution, with pixels one quarter the size of those used by traditional Full HD 1080p projectors. See corner-to-corner clarity and watch movies from much closer than you would in Full HD.</p>

<h6>Ultra-short throw distance for flexible installation</h6>
<p>The VPL-VZ1000ES has been designed with flexible installation in mind. Place the projector 6” away from a wall and you’ll enjoy a beautiful 100” (diagonal, 16:9 aspect ratio) display; move the projector 10” away from the wall and this screen size increases to a huge 120”. So whether it’s placed on the floor, mounted on the ceiling or used for rear projection, you can be sure that you’ll always see the big picture.</p>

<h6>2500 Lumens for spectacular brightness</h6>
<p>Savor the action with an incredible 2500 lumens brightness, for high contrast across the screen. A highly efficient Z-Phosphor laser light generates the brightness required for vibrant images across the whole screen.</p>

<h6>High dynamic contrast for stunning realism</h6>
<p>The VPL-VZ1000ES's SXRD panels and laser light source help the projector achieve a high dynamic contrast. This means that the full color spectrum – from deep, inky blacks through to vibrant reds, blues and greens – is replicated with fine detail and realism, making every scene spring to life for truly immersive cinematic experience.</p>

<h6>Reality creation upscales your favorites</h6>
<p>Upscale your existing Blu-ray Disc and DVD movies to near 4K-quality. The super-resolution Reality Creation 4K upscaler analyses every pixel in any direction, then employs a digital signal processing algorithm to map pixels against an ever-evolving picture patterning database, compiled from over 10 years of expertise, to enhance colors, contrast, and textures.</p>

<h6>Watch for longer with a Z-Phosphor laser light</h6>
<p>Inside the VPL-VZ1000ES is an ultra-pure, reliable Z-Phosphor laser light source. You'll enjoy perfectly clear 4K pictures plus up to 20,000 hours of uninterrupted operation, with no lamp replacement and virtually zero maintenance.</p>

<h6>General specifications:</h6>
