    <td colspan="2"><p>Enjoy 4K HDR entertainment on our X930E with Android TV. With the new Slim Backlight Drive, this television offers extraordinary brightness in an ultra-thin design and with the incredible performance of the 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme, everything you watch is improved to near 4K HDR quality.</p>

<h6>Uncover The Detail With 4K HDR</h6>
<p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) will change the way you look at TV. Combined with 4K Ultra HD resolution, HDR video content delivers exceptional detail, color and contrast, with a far wider range of brightness than other video formats. The result is the most lifelike picture TVs have ever been able to create, with brilliant highlights and fine detail.</p>

<h6>Everything Should Look Like 4K HDR</h6>
<p>Our newly developed 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme outperforms our conventional 4K Processor X1 with 40% more real-time image processing power. It takes everything you watch and improves it to near 4K HDR quality. Object-based HDR Remaster technology can detect, analyze and optimize each object in the picture individually to adjust the overall contrast for a more natural and realistic picture on screen.</p>

<h6>Extraordinary Brightness, Ultra Slim Design</h6>
<p>Feel the sunlight burst through the trees. Our Slim Backlight Drive+ directs light where it’s needed, filling scenes with extra brightness and deep contrast, all in an ultra-slim TV.</p>

<h6>Ten Times The Contrast</h6>
<p>By precisely balancing the light output across the screen, dimming some areas and boosting others, X-tended Dynamic Range PRO 10x reveals a brightness range ten times that of a conventional LED-backlit TV. When combined with an HDR signal you’ll experience even greater brilliance in every scene as it increases the quality of HDR with finely-gradated bands of color and more vibrant hues.</p>

<h6>Vibrant Colors, Smooth Gradations</h6>
<p>Colors are as rich and vivid as nature’s own thanks to the Triluminos Display with more shades of red, green and blue than ever before. You’ll enjoy vibrant, authentic images that evoke the emotion in every scene. And, 4K HDR Super Bit Mapping reveals thousands of shades and gradations of light, for sunsets as bright and clear as real life.</p>

<h6>Upscale to a more natural picture</h6>
<p>The difference is clear. You’ll see lifelike detail and stunning clarity, no matter what you're watching. Two powerful image improvement databases work together, dynamically improving images in real time. 4K X-Reality PRO upscales images to near 4K clarity while a second database cleans the picture and reduce on-screen noise. Every single pixel is enhanced beautifully by the powerful 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>If TVs are measured on picture quality, then the Sony Z-series stands alone. Near perfect black levels combine with the ability to reproduce the brightness and color of the real world, while your favorites get up scaled to near-4K HDR brilliance. It’s a viewing experience that can’t be replicated.</p>

<h6>Unrivaled picture quality</h6>
<p>The all-new Backlight Master Drive can display an unprecedented dynamic range with near perfect black levels and dazzling brightness. How?</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrete LED Control: Backlight Master Drive uses a new, innovative algorithm to control the TV’s ultra-dense LED structure. Each LED is controlled individually for a picture even more precise than that of a standard full-array TV, which groups LEDs into larger zones.</li>
<li>Calibrated Beam Design: Send light only where it is needed. Each LED emits a straight beam for greater brightness and more accurate contrast than ever before.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Upscaling to near 4K HDR</h6>
<p>Our newly developed 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme outperforms our conventional 4K Processor X1 with 40% more real-time image processing power. It takes everything you watch and improves it to near 4K HDR quality. Object-based HDR Remaster technology can detect, analyze and optimize each object in the picture individually to adjust the overall contrast for a more natural and realistic picture on screen.</p>

<h6>Backlight brilliance</h6>
<p>Experience greater brilliance in every scene. X-tended Dynamic Range PRO utilizes the discrete LED control of Backlight Master Drive to create images with brighter peaks and more shadow detail. When combined with HDR video, X-tended Dynamic Range PRO increases the quality of HDR so you experience even greater color and contrast.</p>

<h6>Uncover the detail with 4K HDR</h6>
<p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) will change the way you look at TV. Combined with 4K Ultra HD resolution, HDR video content delivers exceptional detail, color and contrast, with a far wider range of brightness. The result is the most lifelike picture TVs have ever been able to create, with brilliant highlights and fine detail.</p>

<h6>Clear picture, smooth gradations</h6>
<p>Sunsets are as bright and clear as real life. Super bit mapping 4K HDR, a feature of the 4K HDR Processor X1 Extreme, reveals thousands of shades and gradations of light. It creates a smooth, natural picture as you watch, without the 'banding'. 14-bit signal processing recognizes subtle color transitions and effectively smooths out the gradation between shades, to show 64 times the color levels of a conventional display.</p>

<h6>More color, depth and realism</h6>
<p>Colors are as rich and vivid as nature’s own thanks to the TRILUMINOS Display with more shades of red, green and blue than ever before. You’ll enjoy vibrant, authentic images that evoke the emotion in every scene. When combined with HDR video, TRILUMINOS Display further increases the color depth for noticeably brighter and more realistic colors.</p>
