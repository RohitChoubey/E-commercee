That’s symptomatic of the way Marantz has always done things: while it always aims for the most elegant engineering solution, the listening test is always the final arbiter.

And while that might be better for production costs, it isn't better for sound reproduction. The SP-BS22-LR speakers utilize a true curved cabinet design. So besides the aesthetics being considerably more pleasing, this stiffer design reduces standing sound waves inside the cabinet, resulting in high-performance and exceptional sound quality.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you look at them, you'll also notice the unique speaker grills.

It's an important job, and it uses circuitry like inductors and capacitors to accomplish it. Most speakers use an extremely simple, low-cost crossover made up of a single capacitor and inductor. The Pioneer SP-BS22-LR utilizes a sophisticated 6-element, high-quality crossover. The reasoning is simple: because it's one more way of ensuring high quality sound that makes its presence known.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eWoofer\u003c\/em\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the SP-BS22-LR, Pioneer has added a structured surface to the 4-inch woofer.
